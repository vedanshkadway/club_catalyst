## Overview

This platform is designed to streamline the approval process for events and purchases within the student gymkhana office. It facilitates a structured workflow for approval automation, request generation, and data management.

## Approval Automation

- Requests go through a predefined procedure involving club generation, secretary recommendation, club financial advisor (FA) approval, society FA recommendation, and chairSAP approval.
- Purchase requests have additional rules based on the amount, with different approval chains and monthly limits.

## Request Generation

- Clubs can submit requests with explanations and attachments.
- Requests include monetary aspects, which determine the approval chain.
- The portal supports text and attachments similar to an email.
